/** @file Driver.h
 *  This file contains a class written for the Texas Instruments DRV8308 motor driver chip.

 *  and defines methods to control, command, and read the driver. 
 * 
 *  This code was written mostly by Neil Bedagkar and Bricen Rigby, with help from 
 *  Claude Sonnet 4.5 to write the ISR handling code.
